ContractNLI data access and prompt construction.

This module deliberately contains only the boring parts: downloading the dataset,
loading the splits, turning a document into numbered spans, and rendering the prompt.

Everything that constitutes the *lesson* — calling a model, parsing its answer and
scoring it — lives in the notebooks, where you can read it.

  1. the data       ensure_dataset, load, doc_spans, gold_for
  2. chat turns     SYSTEM, USER, build_system, build_user, build_messages
  3. inspection     INSTRUCTION, build_prompt

Plus CHAT_TEMPLATE_KWARGS, the switch that turns reasoning off.

`build_messages` is the one rendering that matters. Every caller uses it:

  training      notebook 1 writes `prompt` (system + user turns) and `completion`
                (the assistant turn) into each record, and TRL applies the model's own
                chat template to them inside the training job.
  serving       notebook 3 sends the same turns to the vLLM endpoint, which applies the
                same chat template.
  baseline      notebook 4 sends the same turns to Bedrock Converse.

So the string the model trains on and the string it is asked at inference time are
produced by one function and rendered by one template. There is no train/serve skew to
reason about, which is the main thing the messages format buys here.

`build_prompt` renders the same content as a single flat string. Nothing trains or
serves through it — it exists so notebook 1 can print the whole request and measure its
length in one piece.

TURNING REASONING OFF. Nemotron 3 Nano is a reasoning model: asked to deliberate over a
17-item checklist it will spend its whole generation budget inside <think> and get cut
off before the JSON. The switch is NOT a magic string in the prompt — this model's chat
template takes an `enable_thinking` flag:

    {%- set enable_thinking = enable_thinking if enable_thinking is defined else True %}
    ...
    {%- if enable_thinking %}
        {{- '<|im_start|>assistant\\n<think>\\n' }}
    {%- else %}
        {{- '<|im_start|>assistant\\n<think></think>' }}

With the flag false the template pre-fills an empty think block, so the model has no
open <think> to continue and answers directly. It reaches the template three ways, all
carrying the same dict: as a per-record `chat_template_kwargs` column that TRL forwards
(training), as `chat_template_kwargs` in the request body (vLLM), and not at all for
Bedrock, whose models do not share this template.
